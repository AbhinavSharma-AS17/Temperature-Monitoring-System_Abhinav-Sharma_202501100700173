# Temperature Monitoring System

## Problem Statement
A temperature monitoring system is required to simulate temperature readings
received from an IoT sensor.

The system should:
- Accept minimum and maximum temperature limits
- Generate random temperature values
- Take readings at regular intervals
- Calculate the average temperature

---

## Approach
1. Take maximum and minimum temperature limits from the user.
2. Ask the user for the number of temperature readings.
3. Generate random temperature values within the given range.
4. Display each temperature reading.
5. Calculate the average (mean) of the readings.
6. Display the experimental average temperature.

## Sample Output

Enter maximum temperature in Celsius: 35  
Enter minimum temperature in Celsius: 20  
Enter number of readings to take: 5  

READING 1 : The temperature is : 24.0 C  
READING 2 : The temperature is : 31.0 C  
READING 3 : The temperature is : 27.0 C  
READING 4 : The temperature is : 22.0 C  
READING 5 : The temperature is : 30.0 C  

Experimental value obtained : 26.8 C
